<p align="center"> A portfolio resume is a modern and dynamic way to present your professional profile to potential employers or clients. It goes beyond a simple list of qualifications and provides a more comprehensive view of your capabilities. By including visual elements, such as images, videos, or interactive elements, you can effectively demonstrate your skills and achievements.
